# inverse-problem_target-distribution
Code of some attempts to tackle an inverse problem where a probability distribution on the inputs of a bi-modal surrogate is wanted in order to have a desired target distribution on the outputs. A mixture of normal distribution is proposed and the weights, means and covariance matrices are found using a Matlab implementation of MCMC.
The results can be found in the following thesis: http://orca.cf.ac.uk/141807/
